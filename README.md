## About

PILE UP! is a **hyper casual** game made in **~48h** during [Mini Jam 34: Balance](https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-34-balance). The main goal is to **stack** the tallest pile. The player can 
**move** the pile left and right, trying to keep it in **balance**. The pieces keep **falling** from the top. The game ends when the pile **falls sideways**.
